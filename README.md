# OceanTalents

This library is specifically written for a German Arduino-based course on measurement technology, currently available at:
https://ziegenba.pages.io-warnemuende.de/menu.html

It is not designed to be particularly efficient but rather easy to use for students.

It relies on the following libraries:

- Adafruit_Sensor (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor)
- Adafruit_TSL2591_Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TSL2591_Library)
- ClosedCube_HDC1080 (https://github.com/sixfab/Sixfab_WSN_Dev_Board/tree/master/libraries/ClosedCube_HDC1080)
- Adafruit_BMP280_Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BMP280_Library)
- RV8523 (https://github.com/watterott/Arduino-Libs.git)

A combined download of the above libraries is available at: https://github.com/SimonZiegenbalg/Messtechnik-Kurs_Bibliotheken
